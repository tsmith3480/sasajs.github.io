			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>This page is dedicated to a small group people of who listened to the Ross Tucker Even Money podcast and wanted to make their NFL Weekends a little more interesting. They formed a syndicate, each contributed $100 and began betting on the games.</p>

			<p> The group was started by Steve Schilhabel, but the resident math major Tom Lee makes all the picks using the ELO model</p>
